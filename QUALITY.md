# Questory Quality Guide

Phase 14.5–14.75 — Developer Experience, Quality, and Engine Hardening safeguards. Phase 15 adds faction engine tests and guild E2E coverage. Phase 16 adds AI Director engine tests and dev health probe. Phase 17 adds payment, partner, compliance, and risk engine tests. Phase 18 adds platform API, SDK, event bus, webhook, white-label, and enterprise tests.

## Quick commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm run test:unit` | Vitest engine unit tests |
| `npm run test:unit:watch` | Vitest watch mode |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright end-to-end tests (starts dev server) |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui` | Playwright interactive UI |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint (undefined vars, unused import warnings) |
| `npm run check:exports` | Knip unused export scan |
| `npm run check:cycles` | Madge circular dependency report |
| `npm run check:all` | Build + lint + unit tests |
| `node scripts/audit-export-imports.mjs` | Missing import/call-site audit |

## Unit tests

Location: `tests/unit/`

Engines covered:

- `branchingEngine` — branch path commit safety
- `claimFlow` — wrong code, valid claim, duplicate block
- `worldDiscoveryEngine` — snapshot shape and percentage bounds
- `playerProgressionEngine` — XP snapshot and victory hook
- `marketplaceEngine` — snapshot load, safe purchase failure, duplicate player listing block
- `aiNpcEngine` — snapshot, dialogue, relationship labels
- `dateUtils` — safe date conversion and fallbacks
- `craftingEngine` — bonus calculation from crafted artifacts
- `aiNpcEngine` (memory) — encounter and memory flag updates
- `legendaryHuntEngine` — snapshot shape and boss fields
- `factionEngine` — snapshot, territory owner, contributions, rewards, deterministic activity
- `questoryAiDirectorEngine` — snapshot, signals, opportunity ranking, draft safety, prompt payload sanitization
- `paymentEngine` — snapshot, wallets, pending payments, refunds, settlements
- `partnerOperationsEngine` — partners, campaigns, analytics
- `complianceEngine` — KYC, tax status, manual review queue
- `riskEngine` — risk signals, alert levels, no auto enforcement
- `platformApiEngine` — namespaces, read-only snapshots, API keys
- `questorySdk` — init, player, adventure, claim
- `eventBusEngine` — publish and history
- `webhookEngine` — draft endpoints
- `whiteLabelEngine` — brand packs, templates, extensions
- `enterpriseEngine` — organizations, audit log

Setup file `tests/unit/setup.js` preloads `seed.js` to avoid circular import races in Node.

## E2E tests

Location: `tests/e2e/`

| Spec | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| `smoke.spec.js` | App load, Home, Map, Passport, Feed |
| `map-flow.spec.js` | Map container and markers |
| `passport-tabs.spec.js` | Vault tab switching |
| `adventure-flow.spec.js` | Branch path + Union Depot Ghost claim (`DEPOTGHOST`) |
| `full-journey.spec.js` | Map → adventure → branch → claim → passport regression |
| `guilds.spec.js` | Social → Guilds hub, territory detail, rankings |

Playwright config:

- Mocks geolocation (Parsons, KS)
- Skips onboarding overlays via localStorage in `helpers.js`
- Single worker for stability on Windows / Mapbox
- Software GL flags for headless Chromium

First-time setup:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Dev Dashboard

**Route:** Admin → **Dev Health** (dev mode or admin user)

**Screen id:** `dev-health`

Shows:

- Engine health cards (snapshot ok, timing ms, errors)
- State inspector (coins, level, branch path, NPC memory, boss, state size, etc.)
- Approximate saved state size with 4 MB warning threshold
- Known import cycle count (~21, seed.js hub — informational)
- Active engine errors and recent launch funnel errors
- **Run Health Check** button (read-only; branching probe does not mutate state)

Files: `src/developerHealthEngine.js`, `src/DeveloperDashboard.jsx`, `src/developerDashboard.css`, `src/engineSnapshotUtils.js`

## Engine hardening (Phase 14.75)

### Snapshot safety

Major engine snapshots use `wrapEngineSnapshot()` from `engineSnapshotUtils.js` — shallow `Object.freeze` in dev only to catch accidental mutation.

### Import cycle reduction

Standalone modules extracted where safe (no gameplay changes):

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `timelineCore.js` | Timeline actions + normalization (breaks horror timeline cycle) |
| `mapCoordinates.js` | Pure adventure coordinate helpers (breaks accessRules ↔ mapUtils cycle) |
| `messageUtils.js` | `safeMessage`, `REASON_MESSAGES` (breaks stability ↔ draftIntegrity cycle) |

Run `npm run check:cycles` — **~21 known cycles** remain centered on `seed.js` hub imports. Use as a report, not a hard gate.

### Lazy-loaded panels

React.lazy + Suspense for Codex, Living Earth overlay, Developer Dashboard, and screen-level Marketplace/Creator Dashboard routes. Play/adventure flow is not lazy-loaded.

### Timer audit

Removed duplicate world clock interval in `QuestoryMap.jsx` (was 60s + 180s). Other intervals retain `useEffect` cleanup.

## Static analysis

### ESLint

Gentle config in `eslint.config.js` — catches `no-undef` without React style rewrites.

### Knip

`knip.json` scans for unused exports. Informational; large legacy surface may report noise.

### Madge

`npm run check:cycles` reports circular dependencies in `src/`. **Known:** ~21 cycles centered on `seed.js` hub imports (down from ~23 after Phase 14.75 extractions). Documented, not blocking gameplay.

### Import audit scripts

- `scripts/audit-export-imports.mjs` — exported symbols called without imports
- `scripts/audit-imports.mjs` — broader call-site heuristics

## Known limitations

- E2E claim code for Union Depot Ghost is `DEPOTGHOST` (canonical in `seed.js`).
- Map E2E uses fallback map markers when `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` is unset.
- `check:cycles` exits non-zero while legacy cycles remain — use as a report, not a hard gate yet.
- `check:all` does not include E2E (run separately before release).
- Knip may OOM on large repos — re-run with more memory or scan subsets if needed.
- Lazy imports for Marketplace/Creator screens are partially ineffective while those modules remain statically imported from map/passport paths — chunks still split for Codex, Living Earth, Dev Dashboard.

## Before Phase 19

1. `npm run build`
2. `npm run test:unit`
3. `npm run lint`
4. Spot-check Admin → Platform Console and Developer Portal

Source-only commits. Never commit `dist/`.
