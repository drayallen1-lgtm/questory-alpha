# Questory

A persistent, living exploration platform where players collectively discover the real world.

Questory is **not** a GPS treasure-hunting app. The real world is the game board — cities evolve, players shape exploration, and the world changes over time.

**Stack:** React · Vite · Mapbox · Supabase (optional)

## Getting Started

### Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. All variables are optional for local dev.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Supabase anon key |
| `VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN` | Live Mapbox maps |

Without Supabase, the app runs in **local mode** using `localStorage` key `questoryAlpha`.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to `dist/` — **never commit dist/**.

---

## Development Rules

1. Read [PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md](./PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md) before coding
2. Reuse existing engines — check [ENGINE_INDEX.md](./ENGINE_INDEX.md)
3. Run `npm run build` before every commit
4. Commit source only — never `dist/`
5. Extend engines — do not rewrite stable systems
6. Follow the canonical [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) — do not invent phases

Full workflow: [AI_WORKFLOW.md](./AI_WORKFLOW.md)

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Push to GitHub and import in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
2. Confirm build command: `npm run build`, output: `dist`
3. Set `VITE_*` environment variables for Production
4. `vercel.json` configures SPA fallback rewrites

### Supabase setup

1. Run migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
2. Enable Email + Google auth
3. Set redirect URLs to your Vercel domain and `http://localhost:5173`
